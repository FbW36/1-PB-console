//1. Console log a line of text eg. "this is an exercise in console logging" (do not forget quotation marks). 

console.log("this is an exercise in console logging")

// 2. Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**. 

var varTest = "This is the value"

console.log(varTest)

// 3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);

var firstName = "Azael"
var lastName = "Alonso Campana"
console.log(firstName, lastName)

// 4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables. 

var name = "Aycan"
var city = "DÃ¼sseldorf"
var job = "Personal Assistent"
var hobby = "Snorkeling"
var vacationDestination = "Fuerteventura"

console.log(name, city, job, hobby, vacationDestination)

// 5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);** 


console.log("She is called " + name + " living in " + city + ", she quit her job to be " + job + ", because wants to do " + hobby + " in the beautiful island of " + vacationDestination)
