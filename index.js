// 1. console log a line of text
console.log("This is the first exercise");

// 2.Declare a variable and give your variable the following value: "This is the value.". Console log your **variable**.
let exercise = "This is the value";
console.log(exercise);

// 3. Declare a variable called firstName and assign your first name to that variable. Do the same with your last name. Console log both variables. NOTE: When console logging two variables, separate the variables with a comma (,) in the console log e.g. console.log(variable1, variable2);
let firstName = "cindy";
let lastName = "giron";
console.log(firstName, lastName);

// 4. Make a profile of someone's information. Store all the information in variables eg. name, city, job etc. (five variables total) Console log the variables.
let user = "lux";
let age = "29";
let ort = "Demacia";
let role = "mage/support";
let genre = "girl";

// 5. Print a sentence using the profile variables above, adding text where necessary for sentence flow, i.e., "John Smith is a 43 year old teacher who lives in Berlin". **you can combine variables with text in the console by using the plus symbol (+) e.g. console.log("this is a " + variable);**
console.log(
  "Hi! My name is " +
    user +
    " I'm " +
    age +
    " years old " +
    " I live in " +
    ort +
    " I'm working as a " +
    role +
    " and I'm a " +
    genre
);
